## Welcome

If you are looking for a quick and fun introduction to GitHub, you've found it. This class is designed to get you started using GitHub in less than an hour.

## What is GitHub?

We are glad you asked! Many people stumble onto GitHub through one of the millions of Open Source projects it holds or because their employer or professor is using it. Why do these projects use GitHub?

**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**

People around the world use GitHub to collaborate on projects ranging from software to policy documents and cookbooks. You can share your projects with the world and invite your friends to help, or you can keep your projects private and still have easy access wherever you are.

**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**

While you are collaborating, GitHub uses Git (open source, distributed version control software) to keep track of every change made to your project.

**GitHub is so much more.**

GitHub is the collaboration software used to build some of the most powerful applications in the world. It can do a lot of really cool things, but this class is going to focus on getting you started with the basics. We will dig in to the rest later!

## Come Collaborate with Us

In this short class, you will learn the basic GitHub workflow for collaborating with others. We know there is no better way to learn than by getting your hands on a real project, so we asked ourselves:

> What is a fun project we can do with thousands of students around the world?

As GitHub trainers we have the privilege of traveling around the world to teach people Git and GitHub, so we thought: "Wouldn't it be great to see all the places people are learning Git and GitHub?"

And that's how this activity was born. Check out our map so far:

In this class you will add **your own pin to the map**.

## Class Goals

We know some people like to set goals, so here are some for this class:

- confidently use the GitHub.com website to complete the GitHub workflow
- collaborate with ~~strangers~~ new friends on a fun project
- add your pin to the map!
