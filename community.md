# Availability

GitHub's training team answers your questions about this training via a Gitter chat room. Gitter is a chat service that integrates well with GitHub and allows you to authenticate with your GitHub account.

 We will work to answer questions within 12 hours if you ask them Monday through Friday (except on [US holidays](us-holidays/)).

In the meantime, a great way to learn new things is to explain them to others. If you see any questions you feel equipped to answer, please feel free to help!

 Just use the "Open Chat" button on the bottom right of your browser when you begin working through the exercises.  

If you aren't quite ready to get started yet, but want to bookmark the "Help" room, you can find us here:
