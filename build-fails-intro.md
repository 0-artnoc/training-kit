## Help! My Build is Broken!

Here are some of the most common reasons a build may be broken.

#### Spaces at the beginning of the lines

Make sure there are no spaces before the characters on lines 1-5.

#### No spaces after each colon

The format will check for a space after every colon, so `githubHandle:githubteacher` will fail but `githubHandle: githubteacher` will pass.

#### YOUR-USERNAME hasn't been replaced

Replace the placeholder 'YOUR-USERNAME' with your actual GitHub login username.

#### The file hasn't been named correctly

Make sure the file is named `_pins/` at the beginning, and has `.json` at the end.
