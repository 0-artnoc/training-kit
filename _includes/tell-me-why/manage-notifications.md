##Managing Notifications
Once you've commented on an _issue_ or _pull request_, email notifications will start to pour in. By default notifications will be send by email when there is activity in the thread.  
You can also choose to receive notifications of a full repository. Whenever there is a new _issue_, _pull request_ or _comment_ posted you will get a notification.

###You can silence or unmute notifications of _individual threads_.

1. Go to the thread.
2. Click the _(Un)subscribe_ button on the right, under _Notifications_  
Underneath the button a short description explains the current notification status.

###You can _customize the notifications_ in your settings.

1. Go to your profile icon
2. Go to _settings_
3. Select _Notification_ from the menu on the left.  
Here you can adjust your notification preferences

###You can choose to receive notification from a _repository_.

* _**Watch**_ : You will receive a notification when a **new** _issue_, _pull request_ or _comment_ is posted, and when an _issue_ is **closed** or a _pull request_ is **merged**.  
* _**Not watching**_ : Stop receiving notifications, but @ mentions will still alert you.  
* _**Ingore**_ : Stops all notifications.  

###You can _review the notifications_ for repositories you are watching

1. Go to your profile icon
2. Go to _settings_
