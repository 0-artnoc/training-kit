## Reset
Where `revert`, a command we use in other exercises was a command that provided a non-destructive method to clean up commit history and modify changes made to your repository, `reset` is a potentially destructive command. When using reset you are removing any reference to the commit in the repository history and the original copies of the files will no longer be available.
