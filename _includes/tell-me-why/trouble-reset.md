## Reset
 When using `reset` you are removing any reference to the commit in the repository history and the original copies of the files will no longer be available (depending on which mode of `reset` you use). Alternatively,  `revert`, a command we used in other exercises is a command that provides a non-destructive method to clean up commit history and modify changes made to your repository.
