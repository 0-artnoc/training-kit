## Commit --amend

The `commit --amend` command enables you to modify the message and contents (changes that are included) of the _last_ commit you made. This can be helpful if you identify a spelling error or grammatical issue with the commit message you created. This command **only** works with the _last_ commit you made and you need to use other commands to modify commits made prior to your last commit.
