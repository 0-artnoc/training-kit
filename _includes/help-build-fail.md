## Help: My Build Failed

The class repository is using continuous integration through [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) to run tests on the code you have entered. To put it simply, it is checking to make sure the syntax is correct in your file.

The files we are using are very picky. If you made any mistakes, you will see a message that your build has failed. This usually means that the text you entered is incorrect. Check the syntax carefully against the instructions and edit your file as needed.

When you commit your changes, Travis CI will re-check your file.

Keep doing this until you see a message that the build has passed. If you need help, don't forget you can find us in chat or @ mention githubteacher in your pull request.
