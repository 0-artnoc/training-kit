# Activity: Merging Your Pull Requests

After you have received a :+1: or similar approval, it is time to merge your Pull Request.

### Activity Instructions

1. Open the [Pull Request](https://github.com/githubschool/open-enrollment-classes-introduction-to-github/pulls) to be merged.
2. Open the *Conversation* view.
3. Scroll to the bottom of the Pull Request and click the *Merge pull request* button.
4. You can accept the default merge commit message.
5. Click *Confirm merge*.

Now that you have merged your branch, it no longer contains unique work. This means it is ok to follow the instructions in the merge confirmation box and **Delete branch**.
