Now that you have a local copy of the repository, let's use the steps of [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) to make a change in your project. First we will create a branch:

1. Within GitHub Desktop, click "File", then click "New Branch".
1. In the `Name` field, type a meaningful name for your branch. Something like `add-index-page` will work nicely.
1. If you have been following the directions exactly, GitHub Desktop knows to create the new branch based on `master`. If not, select `master` in the `From` field. This tells git what you want the new branch to be like when starting, and what commit will be a parent to your next commit.
1. GitHub Desktop will automatically create your new branch and switch you to it.
