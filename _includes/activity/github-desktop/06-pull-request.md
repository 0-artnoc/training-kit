Now that you have made some local commits, it is time to send your changes to the remote copy of your repository on GitHub.com and open a pull request:

1. On GitHub Desktop, click the button to sync changes. It will either read **Push Origin** or **Publish Branch**. You may have to click it multiple times if it says **Update Origin** or **Pull Origin**.
1. In your browser, go to the ['Pull Requests' tab of the class repository](https://github.com/githubschool/on-demand-github-pages/pulls).
1. Click ['New pull request'](https://github.com/githubschool/on-demand-github-pages/compare).
1. Ensure the `base` branch (the one on the left) is `master` and that the `compare` branch (the one on the right) is the one you created on GitHub Desktop.
1. Complete the fields of the pull request.
