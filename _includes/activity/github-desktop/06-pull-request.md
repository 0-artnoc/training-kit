# Activity: Opening a Pull Request

1. After you have committed your changes, click the Pull Request button.
2. Complete the fields of the pull request just like you would on GitHub.com. (Make sure you know if the main default branch is `master` or `gh-pages`!)
3. Click create pull request. GitHub Desktop will do all of the work of pushing your changes and creating a pull request. When it is finished, you will receive a confirmation message.
4. Go to your repository on GitHub.com, click the **Pull Requests** tab, and see your newly created pull request!
