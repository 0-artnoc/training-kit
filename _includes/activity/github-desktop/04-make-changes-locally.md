1. Double check that your new branch is the selected branch on GitHub Desktop.
1. Open the repository in your preferred text editor.
1. Create a new file named `index.html`.
1. In your `index.html` file, include at least the following two lines: `<h1> Hello World! </h1>` and `<p> My name is GITHUB_USERNAME </p>`. Bonus points for including more information, or using [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/) to create a more robust site.
1. When you are finished, save your changes and close the text editor.
