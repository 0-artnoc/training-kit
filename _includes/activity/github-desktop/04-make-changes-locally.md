# Activity: Add Commits Locally

1. Double check that you're checked out to your branch on GitHub Desktop.
1. Open your preferred text editor.
1. Create a new file with the title `index.md`.
1. In your file, include at least "Hello World" and your username. Bonus points for using markdown, including a bio, or even making a portfolio!
1. When you are finished, save the file and close the text editor.
1. Go back to GitHub Desktop and select the `master` branch.

_When you open your file with the master branch selected, you will notice that the changes you just made to the file are not included._
