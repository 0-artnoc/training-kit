Now that you have what you need for Git and GitHub installed locally, let's create the repository that will hold your new website.

1. On GitHub.com, [create a new repository](https://github.com/new).
1. Name your repository.
1. Enter a description for your repository.
1. We recommend you create a public repository. Public repositories are free. Even if you select a private repository, your published website will be public.
1. Check the box to initialize the repository with a README.
1. Click **Create repository**.

This course is going to use GitHub Pages to create your website. Click the **Tell me why** section below to learn more. To initialize GitHub Pages we need to perform a few more steps:

1. With your repository created, click the **Settings** tab.
1. On the Options section (default information displayed), scroll down to the **GitHub Pages** section.
1. Select the **Source** dropdown, which displays **None** by default, and select **master branch**.
1. Click **Save**.
1. With GitHub Pages enabled, we can select a Theme. Click **Choose a theme**.
1. Decide which theme you would like to use, and click **Select theme**.
1. Your site is published at: USERNAME.github.io/REPONAME.
