Now that you have a local copy of the repository, let's use the steps of [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) to make a change in your project. First we will create a branch:

1. Create a new branch with a descriptive name: `git branch BRANCH-NAME`
1. Type `git status` to see that although you created a new branch, you are still checked out to **master** (as indicated by the text highlighting and the * next to the branch name).
1. Check out to your new branch: `git checkout BRANCH-NAME`.
1. Type `git status` to verify you are now checked out to your new branch.
