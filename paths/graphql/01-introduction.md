    When working on projects, it is common to hard code relevant data. The only problem with this solution is that you are going to need to update that data yearly, monthly, weekly, or even daily! Some examples of data you might want to work with could be:

    - gathering the number of commits you made over a period of time
    - your favorite sports team's record, or
    - information regarding weather patterns in your area.

    What if I told you that there are systems already in place that can enable you to gather the precise data you want, display it, **and** it will automatically update? Allow us to introduce you to APIs.

    **INSERT API WAVING IMG**

    API stands for Application Program Interface, and many websites, software applications, and services use APIs to share and update information.

    This course is going to introduce the concept of using APIs, specifically GraphQL, to gather data and display it on a webpage. To find out more, click "Tell me why" below.

  Learning new technologies is difficult. Whatever your experience with APIs or GraphQL, this course is hands-on and will walk you through the steps to get started. We believe that working with a new technology and getting real experience is the quickest and surest way to learn.

  If you aren't sure why you might use an API right now, that's :ok: :ok_hand:. This course only walks through a few examples, and we'll set you on the path additional use cases.

  For more in depth information on GitHub's GraphQL API, [check out the official documentation](https://developer.github.com/v4/). You can find many use cases and examples of GraphQL in action.
