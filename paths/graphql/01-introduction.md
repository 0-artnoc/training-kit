    When you are working on projects where you want to share data, maybe the number of commits you made over a period of time, your favorite team's record, or information regarding weather patterns in your area it is very common to hardcode that information on your website. The only problem with this solution is that you are going to need to update that data on a schedule, which could be yearly, monthly, weekly, or even daily!

    What if I told you that there are systems already in place that can enable you to gather the precise data you want and display it, **and** it will automatically update? Allow us to introduce you to APIs.

    **INSERT API WAVING IMG**

    This course is going to introduce the concept of using APIs, specifically GraphQL, to gather data and display it on a webpage.

    #### Goals of this page based on outline
    - Motivation, present the problem that needs solving
    - API as the solution (context: dynamic, consumable information)
      - Examples of API usages (format: service, how API is used, link)
