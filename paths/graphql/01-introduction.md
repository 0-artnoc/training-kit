    Modern apps are interdependent and dynamic. For example, you probably sign in to various web apps using your GitHub account. These apps may be grabbing your Avatar photo directly from GitHub or some information about your projects. As an added bonus, the data about your project is always changing, so these connections are constantly updating the information that is displayed.

    GitHub isn't the only web app that does this. A few examples of rich data sources are:

    - [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/): get access to your local weather or report it from you home weather station
    - [Flight stats](https://developer.flightstats.com/api-docs/flightstatus/v2): grab information about any flight
    - [ESPN](http://www.espn.com/static/apis/devcenter/docs/scores.html): keep track of your favorite sports team's record

    This data is available to you because the developers of these apps created a public Application Program Interface (API).

    This course is going to introduce the concept of using APIs via GitHub's GraphQL, and show you how it can be used to gather data from GitHub and make a simple change.

    There are several types of APIs. Learn more by expanding the "Tell me why" section below.

  Learning new technologies is difficult. Whatever your experience with APIs or GraphQL, this course is hands-on and will walk you through the steps to get started. We believe that working with a new technology and getting real experience is the quickest and surest way to learn.

  If you aren't sure why you might use an API right now, that's :ok: :ok_hand:. This course only walks through a few examples, and we'll set you confidently on the path of additional use cases.

  For more in depth information on GitHub's GraphQL API, [check out the official documentation](https://developer.github.com/v4/). You can find many use cases and examples of GraphQL in action.
