    When working on projects, it's common to want access to outside data. But data is often in flux, and that can be a big problem. Depending on your source, the data might change over the course of years, or merely within seconds.

    Some examples of data you might want to work with could be:

    - gathering the number of commits you made over a period of time
    - flight statuses
    - your favorite sports team's record, or
    - weather in your area.

    There are systems already in place that can enable you to gather up to date precise information that you want **and** immediately display it. Allow us to introduce you to APIs.

    API stands for Application Program Interface, and many websites, software applications, and services use APIs to share and update information.

    This course is going to introduce the concept of using APIs via the GitHub GraphQL Query Language, and to gather data and display it on a webpage. To find out more, click "Tell me why" below.

  Learning new technologies is difficult. Whatever your experience with APIs or GraphQL, this course is hands-on and will walk you through the steps to get started. We believe that working with a new technology and getting real experience is the quickest and surest way to learn.

  If you aren't sure why you might use an API right now, that's :ok: :ok_hand:. This course only walks through a few examples, and we'll set you confidently on the path of additional use cases.

  For more in depth information on GitHub's GraphQL API, [check out the official documentation](https://developer.github.com/v4/). You can find many use cases and examples of GraphQL in action.
