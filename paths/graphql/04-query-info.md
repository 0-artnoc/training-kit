  # Using our Query's response

  1. Using the response from the query in the last step, fill in this template.

          ```
          My most recent PRs are: <br>
          1. [title1](url1)<br>
          1. [title2](url2)<br>
          1. [title3](url3)<br>
          1. [title4](url4)<br>
          1. [title5](url5)<br>
          ```
  1. Save this template somewhere where you can get to it later, like a text editor or as a comment in an issue.

  ### Why are we making this query?

  Maybe you are a trying to work on an open source project and want to provide a consistently updated list of other projects you have contributed to. Perhaps you are trying to land a job and want to show your potential employer the projects that you work on. Maybe you already have a job, but you want to be able to show your team or manager what you have been working on recently.

  Either way, this query will automatically generate a list of the projects that you are actively contributing to, and more importantly, doing it automagically.
