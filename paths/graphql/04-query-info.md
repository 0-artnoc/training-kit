  # Why would I use this?

  Maybe you are a trying to work on an open source project and want to provide a consistently updated list of other projects you have contributed to. Perhaps you are trying to land a job and want to show your potential employer the projects that you work on. Maybe you already have a job, but you want to be able to show your team or manager what you have been working on recently. Either way, this query will automatically generate a list of the projects that you are actively contributing to, and more importantly, doing it automagically.

    #### Goals of this page based on outline
    - Context of why we're doing this, explain standups, show this could be useful for weekly updates of work
    - Pick out titles and URLs manually and copy them into this template

    ```
