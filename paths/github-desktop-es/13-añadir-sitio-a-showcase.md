  ## Getting access to the shared repository

  We will use a shared class repository to host a directory of all pages that have been created as a part of this course.

  When you request access via the collaborator issue, we will use a webhook to add you as a collaborator. This will ensure you have the ability to push to this repository, and can add your site.
