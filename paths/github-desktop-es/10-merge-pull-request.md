  ## Why did we merge without collaborating?

  A Pull Request is typically an opportunity for code review and collaboration. In this class, you are creating a personal web site, so you can bypass that step. However, if you'd like anyone to collaborate on your open Pull Request, it's as simple as at-mentioning them.
