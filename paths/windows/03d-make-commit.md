  Crafting a commit using the GitHub Extension in Visual Studio is a relatively straightforward process.

  ### Creating a Commit
  1. Make changes to your project.
  1. In the **Team Explorer** pane, right-click a modified file and select **Commit**.

  #### Selecting All the files
  1. Enter a commit message identifying the changes you made.
  1. Click the **Commit all** button.

  #### Selecting Specific Files
  1. Enter a commit message identifying the changes you made.
  1. Right click the file(s) you want to add to the commit and select **Stage**.
  1. Click the **Commmit staged** button.

  ### Now what?
  After you have created a commit (or many commits) it is `push` your changes to your remote repository and potentially share it with other collaborators on your project.
