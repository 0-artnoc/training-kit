  It isn't'uncommon for developers in a Windows environment to use Microsoft Visual Studio, thankfully, there is a GitHub Extension that empowers you to develop in a familiar environment while collaborating on the GitHub platform.
  Adding a change as an example.

  1. **Tools > Extensions and Updates**
  1. Select **Online** from the left side of the Extensions and Updates window.
  1. Search for `GitHub Extension` using the search bar in the top right corner.
  1. Access the GitHub Extension by selecting **View > Other Windows > GitHub** from the main menu.

  After installing the Visual Studio GitHub Extension, you might want to check out the [official website](https://visualstudio.github.com/index.html) for the extension that includes a description of the different windows and panes you will encounter while using the extension.
