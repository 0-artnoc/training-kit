  Merge Conflicts

tell-me-why: |
  One of the primary reasons to use a collaborative version control system like Git is the ability to collaborate with other people on your project and 'syncing' allows you to share the changes you have made with those other collaborators. In a typical workflow, after making `commit`s to your project, you should be `push`ing those `commit`s to your remote repository.

  As stated above, the use of 'Sync' is just a design decision that the developers for different GUI environments supporting Git workflows used to familiarize users with the idea of sharing their changes and retrieving changes from other users.
