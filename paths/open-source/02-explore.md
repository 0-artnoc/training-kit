  Now, hopefully you wrote things down as prompted on the last page. If you didn't, hopefully you have some ideas fixed in your mind. Otherwise, this next section is going to be difficult.

  We're hoping to open a large quantity of potential repositories, which we'll parse down as time goes on. Open a lot of tabs, it'll be okay.

    - Use [Showcases](https://github.com/showcases) to search for repositories by topic.
    - Use [Trending](https://github.com/trending) to pick based on what's currently popular.
    - Use [Search](https://github.com/search) to search for websites or topics that you're interested in.
      - To find organizations, click "Users" on the left instead of the default "Repositories" view after entering your query.
      - To search by [topic](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=topic%3A+&ref=simplesearch), type a topic that you're interested in after writing `topic: ` in the query field.
    - It's also possible to search by expected ability (like "beginners") via labels. People can make these up, so they vary wildly. Here are a few places to start (You can find more in the **Open Sourced** section).
      - [up-for-grabs](http://up-for-grabs.net/#/tags/) - an aggregated list of repositories specifically seeking new contributors.
      - [your-first-pr](http://yourfirstpr.github.io/) - a community driven issue [collection](https://github.com/yourfirstpr/yourfirstpr.github.io/issues) for finding good starter projects.
      - [first-timers-only](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/) - Another [label](https://github.com/search?q=label%3Afirst-timers-only&state=open&type=Issues) that helps you find your feet. This one has a twitter [bot](https://twitter.com/first_tmrs_only).


  Have a few tabs open? I hope so! On we go!

open-source: |
  - A [list](https://github.com/lucev/beginner-friendly) of beginner-friendly projects, with a Ruby theme.
  - Another great [list](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners) inspired by some of the projects above.
