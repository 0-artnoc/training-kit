   Still on the fence about open source? Meet Bryan.

   Bryan started coding about a year ago. Before that, he didn't know a thing about programming.  Despite this, in his first weeks of learning, part of his weekly ritual was to scour GitHub to seek out some simple issues to contribute to. One day (probably a month or so after he started this ritual), he reached out to all of his friends, bursting with pride, because he had a Pull Request successfully merged into a repository.

   Even better? That repository belongs to Google.

   What did he do?

   The smallest thing! He updated the license to one of _hundreds_ of components that made up one of Google's (at the time) new programming languages.

   That's it! But you know what? Bryan can now say that he is a contributor to Google. Also, this is actually a true story. He's a real person with a real commit to Google, and now works for Uber.

   And even though his change isn't the most inspiring change, the story is what carries. This happened a year ago, and is something that his friends still talk about. And now that story is here, serving as a small inspiration that has the potential to impact anyone who decided to take this course and read this section, before making their own commits and sharing their own stories.

   **cough** _Butterfly Effect_ **cough**  

   Where do you want your story to start?
