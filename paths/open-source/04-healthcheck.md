  Before deciding to contribute to a project, you can inspect a couple of elements of the repository to determine if there is active development on it. Using the [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom) repository as an example, lets review some areas that help determine the health of a repository.

  ## Assessment Tools
  You can also use tools created by the community to help you with your assessment of the repository.

  - [**Is It Maintained?**](http://isitmaintained.com/) helps you assess the average time it takes to close an issue, and how many issues in total are open.
    - To be fair, this isn't always the best way to assess a repository. Sometimes issues stay open for a long time, which may indicate that there aren't enough contributors.
  - [**FOSS Heartbeat**](https://sarahsharp.github.io/foss-heartbeat/) helps you assess community involvement within a repository using contributor participation data.

  Another incredible checklist from the [Contributing to Open Source Guide](http://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute-to-open-source/#a-checklist-before-you-contribute):

  #### Meets the definition of open source

  - Does it have a license? Usually, this is a file called LICENSE in the root of the repository.

  #### Project actively accepts contributions

  Start by looking at commit activity on the master branch. On GitHub, you can see this information on a repository's homepage.

  - When was the latest commit?
  - How many contributors does the project have?
  - How often do people commit? (On GitHub, you can find this by clicking "Commits" in the top bar.)

  #### Next, look at the project's issues.

  - How many open issues are there?
  - Do maintainers respond quickly to issues when they are opened?
  - Is there active discussion on the issues?
  - Are the issues recent?
  - Are issues getting closed? (On GitHub, click the "closed" tab on the Issues page to see closed issues.)

  #### Now do the same for the project's pull requests.

  - How many open pull requests are there?
  - Do maintainers respond quickly to pull requests when they are opened?
  - Is there active discussion on the pull requests?
  - Are the pull requests recent?
  - How recently were any pull requests merged? (On GitHub, click the "closed" tab on the Pull Requests page to see closed PRs.)

  #### Project is welcoming

  A project that is friendly and welcoming signals that they will be receptive to new contributors.

  - Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?
  - Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (ex. IRC or Slack)?
  - Do pull requests get reviewed?
  - Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?

 ### Stars, Forks, and Watch
  The number of people who are `watch`ing, have `star`red, and `fork`ed the repository can be an indiciation of how much impact the project is having. Keep in mind, a repository doesn't _need_ to have a lot of people watching, starring, or forking it for you to want to contribute.

 ### Description / Link
  The description and link section of the repository just displays a brief introduction of the project and potentially a link to a website with more information.

  When reviewing this section, notice the following:

  - Is there a description/link? If so, cool!
  - More importantly, is the description/link something you want to contribute to?

 ### README.md
  The README.md file is the project's chance to inform you about the purpose of the project and potentially what it needs.
  When reviewing the README.md file, you should take notice of a couple of things:

  - How detailed is the README.md?
  - Is it populated at all?
  - Does it feel welcoming and easy to understand?

 ### Issues and Pull Requests
  The number of open Issues and Pull Requests on a project can provide a glimpse into the current activity on the project and might provide some opportunities for you to jump right into the project.

  Keep in mind, Issues are discussions about the project; Pull Requests are a comparison of changes between the deployed or live version and some recent changes submitted by another contributor.

 ### Pulse and Graphs
  The `Pulse` and `Graphs` section of the repository provides visual information about activity on the repository. These sections provide a glimpse into the overall activity of the project.

  ![image-center](../images/os_pulse.png){: .align-center}

  When reviewing the repository's `pulse` and `graphs`, think about:

  - What they look like?
   - Is there recent activity?
   - Does it have active contributors?
   - How many contributors does it have?
