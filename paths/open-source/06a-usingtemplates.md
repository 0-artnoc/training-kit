   When creating an issue or pull request for the first time on a repository, you might encounter a template. The template content can be found in the `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` and `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE` files in the repository (sometimes, found in the `.github` folder).

   ![image-center](../images/os_issueexample.png){: .align-center}

   If the repository you are collaborating on uses template files, you should definitely try to use it when either submitting an issue or pull request. If the repository you are collaborating on does not use template files, it might be something **you** could create with a pull request.
