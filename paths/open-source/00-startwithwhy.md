  Crazy thought, but true; If you're reading this, you're in a position to make changes that can impact the entire world.

  **You**: _But what if I can't code?! :sob:_

  That's fine. :smile: This course doesn't expect you to know any language other than English.

  **You**: _Why should I spend the time? What's at the end of all this?_

  Think of this course as the instruction book for opening doors to any field that you'd like to learn more about or contribute to (when you're ready - no rush).

  Some cool things that are Open Sourced (and on GitHub):

  - Life saving medical software
  - The United States Federal Source Code policy
  - Programming languages that the Internet is built on
  - Books and Tutorials

  By the end, you'll know how to:

  - Find Open Source projects that you care about
  - Critically understand those projects and their responsiveness
  - Contribute to projects (whether this is code or something else)
  - Get involved in communities

  In this section, we're going to briefly discuss the idea of the "Butterfly Effect".

  Fun fact, Wikipedia also uses Open Source ideas.  -->
