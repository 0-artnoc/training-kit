## A preview of what's to come

In this module, you will learn how to create a GitHub repository that can function as a GitHub Pages website. You'll learn how to use GitHub Desktop to work locally.

First, you will create a repository from scratch and turn it into a website.

Then, you will share your project website using our collaborative class repository.

To interact with Git and GitHub, you will use GitHub Desktop to take snapshots of your project, sync your repository with GitHub, and view your project's history.

## Before We Begin

If you haven't already, you will want to complete our [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.github.com/on-demand/intro-to-github/) module. It contains important information on the GitHub Flow you will need to complete this course.

You will also need to download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com).

## Basic Configuration on GitHub Desktop

Once you have installed GitHub Desktop, the app will walk you through the necessary set-up steps. Just in case, let's make sure you have the app configured properly.

Ensure your username and email address match the values set in your GitHub account. This allows the app to share information seamlessly with GitHub.
