## Workflow Review

Now that you have a local copy of the repository, let's use the steps of [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) to make a change in your project.

Remember, we used these steps in [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.github.com/on-demand/intro-to-github/), and we'll use them again here! :smile:

The main steps of the GitHub workflow are:

1. Create a branch
2. Add commits
3. Open a pull request
4. Collaborate, and make more commits
5. Merge the pull request

## Create a branch

{% include activity/github-desktop/03-create-branch.md %}

### What Just Happened?

When you create a branch in your local repository that branch will persist regardless of how you decide to work with your files. So feel free to use your favorite text editor or IDE to work with your files and rest assured that you will only be making changes on your branch.
