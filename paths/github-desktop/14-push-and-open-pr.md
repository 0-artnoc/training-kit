  ## Reviewing the GitHub Flow
  
  We are following the 5 steps of [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), which are:

  1. :white_check_mark: Create a branch
  2. :white_check_mark: Add commits
  3. **Open a Pull Request** :arrow_left: _(This section deals with this step.)_
  4. Collaborate, and make more commits
  5. Merge the Pull Request
