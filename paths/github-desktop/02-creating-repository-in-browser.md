## Why work locally?

In the [Introduction to GitHub module](https://github.github.io/on-demand/intro-to-github/) you learned how to work with a repository using GitHub.com. However, we realize that software development (and the many other types of projects on GitHub) can be complex and working in a web user interface can be limiting.

If you want to:

- Work with multiple files at once
- Build and test your project locally
- Work with your favorite local applications, or
- Work offline

GitHub Desktop will allow you to do so!

## Remote vs. Local

A **remote** repository is the copy of your project that is housed on GitHub.com. You access this copy through a unique URL.

A **local** repository is a copy of the project on GitHub.com that you have "cloned" to your computer. This copy includes all of the files, history, and branches in your project.

## Create a repository on GitHub.com

To get started, let's create a repository on GitHub.com.

Remember, this will be the **remote** repository. It will stay on GitHub.com while you will create a copy to work locally.
