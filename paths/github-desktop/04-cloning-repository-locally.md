## The meaning of a clone

Now that you've created a repository on the remote, the next step is to clone it to your local environment.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/clone-diagram.jpg){: .align-center}

You can name the clone of the repository anything you would like. In this example, we will leave it the same as the remote. You can also choose the location where you would like the cloned repository to be saved.

{% include activity/github-desktop/02-clone-locally.md %}

You may be wondering: *why do I have to create the repository on GitHub if I'll be working locally?*

Actually, you don't have to. If you would like, you can create a repository strictly locally - by either starting a new project from scratch or taking an existing project and adding version control. More on this later.
