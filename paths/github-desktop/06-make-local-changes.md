  ## Your first website

  For this activity, we are really focusing on the steps for working with a repository with GitHub.com and GitHub Desktop. If you are not familiar with web design, then these instructions will create a very basic, unformatted page. 

  There are several tools you can use in combination with GitHub Pages to create a beautiful website. For example, you can download one of the themes on [http://jekyllthemes.org/](http://jekyllthemes.org/) or you can create a regular HTML page. The possibilities are endless!
