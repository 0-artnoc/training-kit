## What is GitHub Pages?

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) is a service that lets you host a website for free, using the Git version control system to manage the content of your site and the GitHub website to publish it online.

## Uses for GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages can be used for all kinds of projects. Perhaps you want to provide documentation for an open source project you are working on, generate an online resume, blog about your travels, or create a website for a small business. GitHub Pages provides a wonderful platform for you to work on and publish content to the web.

## How to enable GitHub Pages

There are many ways to create websites using GitHub Pages. You can:

- Build a site from scratch and upload the HTML and CSS files to host them on GitHub
- Use a built-in template engine called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
- Create an `index.md` file with markdown

Every GitHub repository can be built into a website using Pages. Generally speaking, you can see the website by going to the url: `USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY`. GitHub's [help documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/) contains more information about how this URL might vary.

To set up your repository to use this built in website, you'll need to adjust some settings.
