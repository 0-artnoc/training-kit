## Your first file on Desktop

Now you are ready to make some changes to the files in your local copy of the repository.

We are going to be using [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), a simple formatting language.

{% include activity/github-desktop/04-make-changes-locally.md %}

## Commit your changes

After you have finished making your changes, it is time to commit them. When you are working in the desktop app, you have a lot more control over your commits.

When you were working on GitHub.com, a commit could only include the changes you made to a single file. However, when you are working locally, a commit can include multiple files or you can even pick specific changes within your files that you would like to commit.

When you are ready to add new snapshots of your project to version control, you will assemble the changes you have made into a discrete unit of work: an **atomic commit**. Let's do it now.
