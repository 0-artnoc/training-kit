## Merge Your Pull Request

Good news, this part should be familiar to you!

{% include activity/github-desktop/07-merge-pull-request.md %}

A pull request is typically an opportunity for code review and collaboration. In this class, we are creating a personal web site so we will bypass that step. However, if you'd like anyone to collaborate on your open pull request, it's as simple as at-metioning them.

## Sync your local repo

When you merged your pull request on GitHub.com, the changes you started locally were merged into the `master` branch on the _remote_ repository on GitHub. However, you won't automatically see those changes reflected in your local copy.

To see the changes locally, you will need to **Sync**.

{% include activity/github-desktop/08-sync-desktop.md %}

## Your site is now published :tada:

Great work! You have completed a website using the local workflow with GitHub Desktop. You can see your newly published site at `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY`!

But, you're not done yet! Next, you will join our class repository, practice the workflow again and add your site to our showcase page!
