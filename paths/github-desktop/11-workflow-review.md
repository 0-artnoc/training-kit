## Workflow Review

Now you will see all of the great pages that have been made by others, and share your page with the world in our class repository! To do that, we'll follow the same 5 steps of the GitHub workflow, but on the [class repository](https://github.com/githubschool/open-enrollment-classes-introduction-to-github).

Remember, the 5 steps are:

1. Create a branch
2. Make commits
3. Open a pull request
4. Get feedback
5. Merge your branch

You've followed this workflow twice so far; once in the introduction to GitHub course, and once in this course.

## Add your site to our directory

Let's now add a file to our class repository to tell us your web site's URL.
