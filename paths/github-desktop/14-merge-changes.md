# Merge Your Changes

Once your pull request is ready to merge, go ahead and push the big green button. When you merge, you are introducing the changes you made on your own branch into the main branch of the repository. For this repository, that main 'base' branch is `gh-pages`.

{% include activity/github-desktop/07-merge-pull-request.md %}

## Congratulations!

You've done it! You've created a GitHub Pages website, and collaborated using GitHub desktop to work locally! :tada: :rainbow:
