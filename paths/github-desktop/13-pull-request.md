# Open a Pull Request

Now that you've made commits on your branch, it's time to open a pull request.

Since you've synced your changes to GitHub.com, you could open the pull request on the remote if you'd like. Here are the directions for opening a pull request from GitHub Desktop in case you'd like more practice. However you choose to open a pull request, make sure you include a good description of the changes you're introducing, and ask for feedback!
