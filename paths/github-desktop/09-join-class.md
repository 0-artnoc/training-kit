# Join Our Class Repository

Now that you've created a Pages site using GitHub Desktop, it's time to share your work! You'll add your file to our class repository and see other Pages sites, but only if you have collaborator access.

### Access and permissions on GitHub

Whenever you create a repository, you have control over who can make changes to it. Even if your project is public, you grant access to collaborators. This can look differently if you're working from an organization account instead of your personal account.

We are using the same repository that you collaborated on in the **Introduction to GitHub** course. So, if you haven't completed that course, please do so. If you have, you already have all the proper permissions! :tada:
