  # Making Changes to the Repository

  Once your branch has been created, it is time to add a new file to the repository. First, we will show you the steps. Then, you will have a chance to try it on your branch.

  ## Adding a New File

  To add your pin, you will need to add a new file to the class repository. We will give you specific instructions below, but first let's talk about some of the helpful ways GitHub allows you to add files to your projects.

  - **File Uploader:** if you already have a file on your computer that you would like to add to your repository, you can simply drag and drop it in to the repository window on GitHub.
  - **Create New File:** you can also choose to create a new file in your repository by clicking the `Create New File` button. This will open a simple, web-based file editor where you can simply give your file a name and add the appropriate file extension. The file extension will tell GitHub how to render your content.
  - **Modifying an Existing File:** Sometimes you simply need to make a change to an existing file. If this is the case, navigate to the file using the file directory in the Code tab. Once you have opened the file, click the pencil icon in the top right to open the file in edit mode.

  ## Committing Your Changes

  When you are finished creating or making changes to a file on GitHub, you will scroll to the bottom of the page. There you will find a `Commit new file` section.

  In the first field, you will type a commit message. The commit message should briefly tell others about the changes you are introducing to the file.

  #### Rules to Live By For Commits:

  - Don't end your commit with a period.
  - Keep your commits to 50 characters or less. Add extra detail in the extended description window, if necessary. This is located just below the subject line.
  - Commits use the imperative mood. _Add_ instead of _Added_. _Merge_ instead of _Merged_.
  - Think of your commit as expressing intent to introduce a change.

  Next, you will designate where you want your changes to be committed. If you were on your branch when you clicked the Create New File button, GitHub will prompt you to commit directly to that branch. But, if you forgot to create a new branch, you can do it now.

  Now it's time to add a file to the class repository containing the code for your map pin!
