## Exploring GitHub

Now that you have created (or signed in to) your GitHub account, let's explore:

### Your User Dashboard

When you first log in to your GitHub account, you will land on your dashboard. The dashboard contains an overview of the exciting things happening on GitHub. You can customize the projects you are watching or find quick links to your own projects.

### Your User Profile

Click your user icon in the top right to to access your profile.

Your profile contains information about your activity on GitHub. This is the your public page on GitHub. Some employers will even check out your profile when you apply for a position, so don't forget to add an awesome photo and a fun bio.

### Your GitHub Repositories

We have seen this word "repository" a lot, so let's talk about it. A repository is a container that holds everything related to a specific project.

If you just created your account, you may not have any repositories yet. Let's fix that!

(P.S. Even if you already have some repositories, you will want to follow the instructions below to join the class repository.)
