  ## What's Next?

  We hope this class is only the first step in your journey to learn how to use GitHub, and that it has shown you how easy it is to contribute to projects. If you are ready for next steps, here are some ideas.

  ### Contribute to a Project

  You can use [explore](https://github.com/explore) to find a project to contribute to OR better yet, you can contribute to one of the open source projects that helped make this class a reality:

  - [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll)
  - [Jekyll Theme: Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes)
  - [geojson](https://github.com/geojson)
  - [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/about)
  - [Travis CI](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-web)

  ### Help Others

  Just because you have finished this exercise, doesn't mean you have to leave. Feel free to drop in to the Gitter chat room anytime and help other learners who are completing the class. Or, drop an encouraging note in an old pull request. You might just be the reason they finish!

  ## What is GitHub?

  We are glad you asked! Many people stumble onto GitHub through one of the millions of Open Source projects it holds or because their employer or professor is using it. Why do these projects use GitHub?

  **At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**

  People around the world use GitHub to collaborate on projects ranging from software to policy documents and cookbooks. You can share your projects with the world and invite your friends to help, or you can keep your projects private and still have easy access wherever you are.

  **GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**

  While you are collaborating, GitHub uses Git (open source, distributed version control software) to keep track of every change made to your project.

  **GitHub is so much more.**

  GitHub is the collaboration software used to build some of the most powerful applications in the world. It can do a lot of really cool things, but this class is going to focus on getting you started with the basics. We will dig in to the rest later!

  ## Come Collaborate with Us

  In this short class, you will learn the basic GitHub workflow for collaborating with others. We know there is no better way to learn than by getting your hands on a real project, so we asked ourselves:

  > What is a fun project we can do with thousands of students around the world?

  As GitHub trainers we have the privilege of traveling around the world to teach people Git and GitHub, so we thought: "Wouldn't it be great to see all the places people are learning Git and GitHub?"

  And that's how this activity was born.

  ## Class Goals

  We know some people like to set goals, so here are some for this class:

  - confidently use the GitHub.com website to complete the GitHub workflow
  - collaborate with ~~strangers~~ new friends on a fun project
  - add your pin to the map!
