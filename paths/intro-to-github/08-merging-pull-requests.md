## What's Next?

We hope this class is only the first step in your journey to learn how to use GitHub, and that it has shown you how easy it is to contribute to projects. If you are ready for next steps, here are some ideas.

### Contribute to a Project

You can use [explore](https://github.com/explore) to find a project to contribute to OR better yet, you can contribute to one of the open source projects that helped make this class a reality:

 - [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll)
 - [Jekyll Theme: Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes)
 - [geojson](https://github.com/geojson)
 - [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/about)
 - [Travis CI](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-web)

### Help Others

Just because you have finished this exercise, doesn't mean you have to leave. Feel free to drop in to the Gitter chat room anytime and help other learners who are completing the class. Or, drop an encouraging note in an old pull request. You might just be the reason they finish!
