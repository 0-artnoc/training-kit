  ## Exploring Our GitHub Repository

  Now that you have a repository, check out this short video to learn about the key features it contains:

  ### More Great Features

  The video covered some of the most commonly used features. Here are a few other items of interest you can find GitHub repositories:

  - **Wiki**: GitHub also has a place to create and store your relevant project documentation.
  - **Pulse**: Pulse is our project's dashboard. It contains information on the work that has been completed and the work in progress.
  - **Graphs**: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity, including who has contributed, when the work is being done, and who has forked the repository.

  ### Special Files

  In the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:

  - **CONTRIBUTING.md**: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for collaborating on the repository. The link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone begins to create a new issue or pull request.
  - **ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md**: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is yet another special file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always want to gather certain types of information for bug reports, you can include it in the issue template and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.

  Speaking of issues, let's jump back to the Issues tab now.

  ## Using GitHub Issues

  GitHub issues are used to record and discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:

  - Replacing email for project discussions, ensuring everyone on the team (even your future team member) has the complete story.
  - Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests.
  - Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions.
  - Allowing you to easily pull the right people into a conversation with @ mentions and team mentions.

  ### Managing Notifications

  It won't take long for GitHub to start sending you lots of email notifications about the things happening in our project. If you would like to learn how to customize (or reduce) the notifications you receive from GitHub, check out this video:
