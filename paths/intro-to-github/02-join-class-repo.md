  ## Using GitHub Issues

  GitHub issues are used to record and discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:

  - Replacing email for project discussions, ensuring everyone on the team (even your future team member) has the complete story.
  - Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests.
  - Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions.
  - Allowing you to easily pull the right people into a conversation with @ mentions and team mentions.

  ## Why Did We Ask You to Comment on this Issue?

  When you sign up for GitHub, you automatically have **Read only access** to any public repository. This means you can look around, comment on Issues and Pull Requests, and open new Issues to report bugs or request features on your favorite projects. You can also create repositories on your own account!

  However, you can't make changes directly on someone else's project unless you use a special workflow (called Fork and Pull) or they give you collaborator access.

  For this repository, we have created a webhook that adds you as a collaborator when you comment on this issue. If you completed the steps above, you are ready to be a collaborator on our project!
