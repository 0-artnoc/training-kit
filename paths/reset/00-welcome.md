  This course is a quick overview of the `git reset` command and in the next 15 minutes you are going to be introduced to functionality of `git reset`s modes. If you have taken other courses with us in the past you should be familiar with the idea of using repositories when working with Git, however, for this class all of the exercises will be conducted on your local machine!

  ## Prerequisites
  It isn't required to complete any of the other courses available on the GitHub On Demand Training site, however, the functionality of the `reset` command might not make sense if you aren't familiar with the core Git functionality covered by our other offerings.
