  This course is comprised of a handful of scenarios that you might find yourself in while working with Git. Before getting started with the scenarios though, you should perform the following:

    - Create a test repository on [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com)
    - Clone the test repository to your local machine

  ## Scenarios
  - Committed Something on Accident

    During your workflow, you might have gotten excited and made a commit before you had actually finished your thought. Maybe you made the commit without adding all of the related files. Perhaps your commit included changes that were unrelated. In either case, we can fix that, just follow along and `git` out of trouble.

  - Commit to Wrong Branch

    So you got excited about making some changes and accidentally committed your changes to the wrong branch? Happens **all** the time. This scenario walks you through the steps required to successfully remove those commits and commit them to the right branch, even if you already pushed them up!

  - Commit Message Sucks

    'Edited stuff' might have seemed like a decent commit message at 3am, but in hindsight, you might realize you want to provide more context. Covering the different commands you can use to `revert` the error of your commit message-ways, this scenario identifies how to get more descriptive.

  - Commit Broke EVERYTHING

    The sky is **not** falling down chicken little, we can make everything right-as-rain, and this scenario shows you how to fix that last commit.
