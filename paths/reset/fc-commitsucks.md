  As you begin creating commits to identify the changes you are making to the files you might 'accidentally' create a commit message that is borderline atrocious; something like 'Fixed the thing'. Although you are definitely aware of the **thing** you just **fixed**, other collaborators including future you, might not know what it is you fixed and more importantly, **why** you needed to fix it. Thankfully, Git is well aware of our tendency to craft terrible commit messages and has a handful of commands that save even the vaguest commit message.

  So you have a couple of options when it comes to fixing a bad commit message that, so first, we need to identify if:

   > Am I trying to fix the **last** commit I made or commit a few commits back?

  If you aren't fixing your last commit, skip down some. If you are fixing the **last** commit you made you can do the following:

   1. thing
   1. thing
   1. thing

  If you aren't fixing your **last** commit, you can perform the following:

   1. thing
   1. thing
   1. thing
