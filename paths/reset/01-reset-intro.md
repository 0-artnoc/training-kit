  When working with Git, you might find yourself in a position where the things you have been working on don't meet your initial needs or aren't working. The `git reset` command allows you to 'reset' your repository (and your Staging Area / Working Directory) to a specific moment in time.

  In this course we discuss three distinct modes of the `reset` command:

  - `--soft`
  - `--mixed`
  - `--hard`
