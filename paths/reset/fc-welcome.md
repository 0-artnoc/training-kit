  It isn't uncommon to make a mistake while working with Git, but don't fret, everyone does it. Getting out of a mess, can be just as easy as getting into one if you know the tools at your disposal to save your project and prevent public embarrassment. This course outlines the different commands you can use to get out of almost **any** sticky situation.

  Unlike our other [courses](https://services.github.com/on-demand/), this course doesn't follow a linear learning path and you can jump into any of the different scenarios provided. So `git` ready to learn about how to get out of trouble with a healthy dose of terrible `git` puns.
