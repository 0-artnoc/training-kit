  For our app, we are going to build a [memory game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game)). You can find the code for the web application [here on Codepen](https://codepen.io/githubteacher/pen/brRvVz).

  On Codepen, you can see there are three main sections of code; `html`, `css`, and `js`. These will map out to be our `src/index.html`, `src/style.css`, and `src/script.js`.

  1. Copy the code from the `html` tab on Codepen into the `src/index.html` file locally. Paste the code so it replaces the existing text ("Well hey there!!!") between `<body>` and `</body>`.
  1. Save and commit your changes.
  1. Start the app again by typing `electron-forge start`. At this point, you should only see text without graphics or functionality.
  1. Quit the app by pressing Ctrl + C in your Command Line Interface.

  > If you don't understand everything in the `.html` file, that's okay. Remember the resources listed [at the beginning of the course](), and know you can always go back and learn more!
