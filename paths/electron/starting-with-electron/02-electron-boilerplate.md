  To begin, we will set up a base electron app using a boilerplate called [electron-forge](https://electronforge.io/). To do that, we need to go through a few steps.

  1. Find the terminal and create a directory for the project: `npm install -g electron-forge`
  1. Initialize a new project: `electron-forge init electron-app`
  1. CD into that app's directory: `cd electron-app`

  Important files to watch out for in any Electron app:

  - `package.json`
  - `package-lock.json`
  - `src/index.html`
  - `src/index.js`

  Any Electron app has [2 types of processes](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/quick-start.md) that interact with each other. The main process, initialized by `package.json`, and a renderer process generated by each web page.

  - `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists your project's details and dependencies.
  - `package-lock.json` - If you're using NPM 5 or greater (you can check by running `npm -v`), you'll also get a [`package-lock.json` file](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package-lock.json). This file aims to keep versions of dependencies identical across projects.
  - `src/index.html` - A web page to render. Each web page will spin off its own renderer process.
  - `src/index.js` - The default script called by `package.json` to create windows and handle system events. Runs the app's main process.

  _Potential TODO_: Add node/npm description here?
