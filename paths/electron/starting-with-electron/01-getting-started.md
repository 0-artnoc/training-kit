  ### Software Skills

  Electron makes it possible to use web technologies to create native desktop applications. So, to use Electron fully, you will want to be proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

  How proficient is proficient enough? To create an app on electron with web technologies, you would need the same level of proficiency that you'd need to create that app for the browser. With this tutorial, you'll see exactly how easy it is to use web application technology to create a desktop app.

  For today's course, basic knowledge of these technologies is more than enough. There are countless great resources for learning more about HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We recommend the following resources:

  #### HTML, CSS, and Javascript

  - [The Best Places to Learn to Code for Absolutely Free](https://learntocodewith.me/posts/code-for-free/)
  - [Awesome, a curated list of learning resources](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

  If you don't think you know enough, don't worry. We'll walk you through what you need to get this app running, even if you don't have experience in these technologies yet.
