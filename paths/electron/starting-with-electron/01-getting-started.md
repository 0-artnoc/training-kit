  Welcome to the first of many courses in relation to Electron!  

  Electron makes it possible to use web technologies to create native desktop applications.

  Experienced web developers can seamlessly become app developers by incorporating Electron into their toolkit. Beginner programmers can have the same instant results seen in building web sites without the historical headaches of app development.

  Before we get started, let's identify the things you are going to need to be successful in this course.

  ### Environment Setup
    - [Git installed](./github-cli/git-configuration)
    - [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
    - [GitHub account](./intro-to-github/create-github-account)
    - [Excited to learn new things](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/cheering_minions.gif)

  ### Software Skills

  A familiarity with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

  **_What if I'm not ready?_**

  Don't worry. We'll walk you through what you need to get today's app running, even if you don't have ample experience in these technologies.

  **_What counts as familiar enough?_**

  On your own, to create an app on Electron with these languages, you would need the same level of proficiency that you'd need to create that app for the browser.

  With this tutorial, you'll see exactly how easy it is to use web application technology to create a desktop app.

  For today's course, the basics are more than enough.
