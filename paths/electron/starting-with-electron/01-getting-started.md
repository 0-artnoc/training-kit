  - Before you get started
     - :computer: computer
      - [git installed](./github-cli/git-configuration)
      - [github account](./intro-to-github/create-github-account)
      - [Excited to learn new things](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/cheering_minions.gif)

  - Helpful but not necessary to complete course
        - Basic website knowledge (html / css)
        - Understanding of what Javascript is
          - Although you don't need to be a Javascript master to complete the course, if you feel like learning more about Javascript after taking this course you should check out the **Basic Javascript** course by our friends over at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseBasicJavaScript).
