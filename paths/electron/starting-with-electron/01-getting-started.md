  ### Environment Setup

  Before we get started, let's identify the things you are going to need to be successful in this course.

  - Install [Git](../../github-cli/git-configuration)
  - Install [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  - Create a [GitHub account](../../intro-to-github/create-github-account)
  - Get [excited to learn new things](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/cheering_minions.gif)

  ### Software Skills

  If you are already familiar with HTML, CSS, and Javascript then adding Electron to your toolkit will be a piece of cake. For this course, the basics are more than enough.

  **_What if I'm still learning?_**

  Don't worry. We'll walk you through what you need to get today's app running, even if you don't have much experience in these technologies.

  **_What counts as familiar enough?_**

  Creating an app on your own requires the same level of proficiency that you'd need to create that app for the browser. If you are just getting started, here are a few free courses to consider:

  - [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map)
  - [The Best Places to Learn to Code for Absolutely Free](https://learntocodewith.me/posts/code-for-free/)
