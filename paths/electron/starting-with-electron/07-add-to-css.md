  Just like with the `src/index.html` file, now we will copy the contents for the css.

  1. Copy the contents of the `css` tab on Codepen into the `src/style.css` file.
  1. Spin up the app and see how things look different. There should be style now, but you should still be unable to play the game.
  1. Quit the app by pressing Ctrl + C in your Command Line Interface.
  1. Save and commit your changes.
