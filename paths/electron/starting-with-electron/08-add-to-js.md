  Finally, let's add the fun part: the Javascript!

  1. Copy the Javascript from Codepen into the `src/script.js` file.
  1. Spin up your app, and see how it works.
  1. Save and commit your changes.

  TODO -
  - callback to resources to learn JS
  - discuss how it can be made more complex
     - maybe we can add some "extra credit" resources where we say, try to add X functionality and provide the answer in a TMW section (similar to the GraphQL course)
  - Troubleshooting
