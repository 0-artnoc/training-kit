  Finally, let's add the fun part: the Javascript!

  1. Copy the Javascript from Codepen into the `src/script.js` file.
  1. Spin up your app, and see how it works.
  1. Save and commit your changes.

  It's great to have a working game! What else could you build? How could you change this game? Feel free to make it your own by changing the images, changing the game functionality, or even adding sound!
