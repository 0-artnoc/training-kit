# Electron 101: Building an Electron App from Scratch

## Things to Know
- Not prereqs
   - Baseline things to get started:
      - computer
      - git installed
      - github account
      - excited to learn new things
   - Helpful but not necessary to complete course
      - Basic website knowledge (html / css)
      - Understanding of what Javascript is
- Listed to make this course more accessible to all, regardless of JS skill
- Let users know that full stack JS knowledge is best for Electron development
    - Provide links to freeCodeCamp JS intro courses perhaps?
    - Explain that JS knowledge is useful for enhancing the application, but won't be necessary to complete the course
- Point to resources

## Creating the Boilerplate Directory
- mkdir
- npm init
- npm install electron
- creating the files that we'll need within the directory
- explaining all files at high level
- making it a git repository
  - this might be an opportunity for us to show them how to take an existing project and ADD it to GitHub since we normally have them set the repo up on GH then clone it

## Creating App Files
- add to index.html, style.css, and main.js
   - this might be an opportunity to breakdown the specific things contained within the `.js` and `.html` file to show how it makes the application work
- recall the resources in the beginning for users who this goes over their heads 
- discuss how it can be made more complex
   - maybe we can add some "extra credit" resources where we say, try to add X functionality and provide the answer in a TMW section (similar to the GraphQL course)

## Starting the app
- electron .
- what to look for
- using the app
- developer tools
