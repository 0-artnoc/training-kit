## Learning goals:


Converting an Existing Web App: I see this as doing git init inside a web-app I have already created and now want to make in to a native app.

Take an existing, simple app and move it to an Electron app.

- Could be with a codepen app, or something on GitHub, like GitHub Games OR http://alysonla.github.io/hubber-memory-game/
- Move from "this works somewhere online" to "this works locally on my machine"
- Includes setup of Electron and basic principles of what it is
- By the end, user can spin up their app and have it working locally.
