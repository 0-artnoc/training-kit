  ## Preparing Electron Apps for Download


  Most commonly, electron apps are shared via [GitHub Releases](https://help.github.com/articles/about-releases/). People who create and package their own applications upload the binaries to a GitHub repository where others can download them. You can see some great examples of this on the [electron app page](https://electron.atom.io/apps/). This is free, version controlled, and kept cleanly alongside your code.

  You could then link to your downloads from your very own [GitHub pages site](https://pages.github.com/), or any site for that matter. [Learn how to make your own GitHub Pages site here](https://services.github.com/on-demand/github-cli/).

  We recommend [this help documentation for creating releases on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/).
