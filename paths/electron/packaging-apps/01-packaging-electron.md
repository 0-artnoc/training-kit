  ## Getting Started with `electron-packager`

  ### Packaging for different environments
  - Needs for Windows, OSX, and Linux
  - Packaging can be done for each OS, but the UI isn't automatically made to look native in the process
  - Many factors make this somewhat complicated. It is a different process based on your OS and the OS you're trying to go to.

  ### Tools to use
