  ## Testing that the packages work

  Now that you've created and packaged the application for many operating systems, you may want to ensure that the app will work as expected. The obvious way to do this is to share it with yourself or someone you trust who has access to that operating system and try it manually. However, there are other ways to do this.

  - Talk about community recommendation
  - Allude to automated testing but probably not walk through it
