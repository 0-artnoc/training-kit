# Electron 102: Packaging Electron Apps

Main goal: Going from local to something someone can download

## Packaging for different environments
- Needs for Windows, OSX, and Linux
- Packaging can be done for each OS, but the UI isn't automatically made to look native in the process

## Tools to use
- How to do this with Electron
- Other libraries to use

## Adding an Icon
- Including the icon image for the program 
- give recommendations on what type of image is allowed (open or public domain) and what size would be best.
- possibly include [icon library](https://useiconic.com/open) suggestions

## Common Challenges
- Problems that come up

## Testing that the packages work
- How to test the packages
- Allude to automated testing but probably not walk through it
