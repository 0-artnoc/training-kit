  You might have heard in hushed whispers the term _merge conflict_ from another Git user. Maybe you have encountered one yourself and had to Google your way out. You might also just be exploring everything Git has to offer and have no idea what a merge conflict is.

  This course is designed for all of you. We demystify the merge conflict and, through a series of examples, prepare you to face off against the evil merge conflict and be the hero of the day!

  In this course, we have created a few conflicts for you to resolve in a sample repository. This repository contains a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) powered [resume](https://github.com/jglovier/resume-template). That means, when you finish this course, you will have more than a few merge conflicts under your belt. You will also have a shiny new resume.

  Don't worry, when you're all done, we'll provide instructions for polishing your resume and getting it ready to share with others.

  If you have any questions while taking the course, make sure to create an Issue in the primary [class repository](https://github.com/githubschool/on-demand-merge-conflict/issues).
