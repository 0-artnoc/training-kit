  You might have heard in hushed whispers the term _merge conflict_ from another Git user. Maybe you have encountered one yourself and had to Google your way out. Perhaps you might also just be exploring everything Git has to offer and have no idea what a _merge conflict_ is.

  This course is designed for all of you. We demystify the _merge conflict_ and through a series of examples prepare you to face off against the evil _merge conflict_ and be the hero of the day!
