  You might have heard in hushed whispers the term _merge conflict_ from another Git user. Maybe you have encountered one yourself and had to Google your way out. Perhaps you might also just be exploring everything Git has to offer and have no idea what a merge conflict is.

  This course is designed for all of you. We demystify the merge conflict and through a series of examples prepare you to face off against the evil merge conflict and be the hero of the day!

  But wait! This course doesn't just help you learn about merge conflicts, it will provide you with a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) powered [resume](https://github.com/jglovier/resume-template). You'll modify sections of the resume as you complete the merge conflict exercises, and we'll provide instructions for polishing it.

  If you have any questions while taking the course, make sure to create an Issue in the [class repository](https://github.com/githubtraining/on-demand-merge-conflict/issues).
