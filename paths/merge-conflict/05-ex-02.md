  Since we customized the resume to include our information, we should include our current professional experience. To include our experience we need to modify the `experience.yml` file.

  1. In your forked version of the repository, checkout to the branch named: `username-experience`.
  1. While on that branch, open the `_data/experience.yml` file.
  1. Modify on the content on lines 2 through 6 making sure to provide information in the `company`, `position`, `duration`, and `summary` lines.
  1. Save your changes to the `experience.yml` file and create a new commit.
  1. With your changes committed on your local copy of the repository, `push` your changes to your remote repository.
  1. Create a new pull request. Use the **base:** of `master` and the **compare:** of `username-experience`.
  1. Although GitHub reports that you **Can't automatically merge** these changes, you can still click **Create pull request**.
  1. In the **This branch has conflicts that must be resolved** section of the pull request, you can click the **Resolve conflicts** button to resolve the merge conflict.
  1. It would appear that Teddy, Mort, and Jimmy Pesto recently made changes to the `master` branch and modified the same file you did, this is what is causing the merge conflicts.

  1. Similar to when we had to resolve a merge conflict with Bob's changes, remove Teddy, Mort, and Jimmy's contributions from the `experience.yml` file. If you need a refresher on how to resolve a merge conflict, check the **I need a refresher** section below.
  1. With the merge conflict markers removed, click **Mark as resolved**.
