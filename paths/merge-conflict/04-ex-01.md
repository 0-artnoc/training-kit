  We need to modify the resume template so it contains our information. Using the GitHub Flow, we can make those changes by:

  1. In your forked version of the repository, checkout to the branch named: `username-config`.
  1. While on that branch, open the `_config.yml` file.
  1. Lines `12-19` should be modified with your information. If you would prefer to create a fictional resume, your favorite fictional character's information.
  1. After making the changes, create a commit, an example commit message might be: `Add my information`.

      > If you made the changes on your local machine, push your changes back to repository on GitHub.

  1. Create a new pull request. Select **base fork:** username/on-demand-merge-conflict and the **Comparing changes** screen will use your repository branches. Use the **base:** of `gh-pages` and the **compare:** of `username-config`.
  1. Although GitHub reports that you **Can't automatically merge** these changes, you can still click **Create pull request**.
  1. In the **This branch has conflicts that must be resolved** section of the pull request, you can click the **Resolve conflicts** button to resolve the merge conflict.
  1. It would appear that Bob Belcher recently made changes to the `gh-pages` branch and modified the exact same line you did, this is what caused the merge conflict to occur.

      > To dive into all of the odd symbols on your screen, check out the **Tell me why** section.

  1. Remove Bob's contributions to the `gh-pages` branch by deleting all of the content below the `=======` and above the `>>>>>>> gh-pages` content.
  1. We still can't **Mark as resolved** because we need to remove the **merge conflict** markers. Delete the following lines: `<<<<<<< username-config`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>> gh-pages`.
  1. With the merge conflict markers removed, click **Mark as resolved**. Congratulations, you successfully resolved a merge conflict!
