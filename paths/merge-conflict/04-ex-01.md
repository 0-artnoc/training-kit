  We need to modify the resume template so it contains our information. Using the GitHub Flow, we can make those changes by:

  [![instructions for this activity](../../images/gifs/merge-conflict/config-merge.gif)](../../images/gifs/merge-conflict/config-merge.gif)

  1. In your imported version of the repository, checkout to the branch named: `username-config`.
  1. While on that branch, open the `_config.yml` file.
  1. Lines 12-19 should be modified with your information. If you would prefer to create a fictional resume, your favorite fictional character's information.
  1. After making the changes, create a commit, an example commit message might be: `Add my information`.

      > If you made the changes on your local machine, push your changes back to repository on GitHub.

  1. Create a new pull request. Use the **base:** of `master` and the **compare:** of `username-config`.
  1. Although GitHub reports that you can't automatically merge these changes, you can still start the pull request. Click **Create pull request**.
  1. In the **This branch has conflicts that must be resolved** section of the pull request, click the **Resolve conflicts** button to resolve the merge conflict.
  1. It would appear that Mummytocat recently made changes to the `master` branch and modified the exact same line you did, this is what caused the merge conflict to occur. Click "Resolve conflicts", and remove Mummytocat's contributions to the `gh-pages` branch by deleting all of the content below the `=======` and above the `>>>>>>> gh-pages` content.

      > To dive into all of the odd symbols on your screen, check out the **Tell me why** section.

  1. We still can't mark as resolved because we need to remove the merge conflict markers. Delete the following lines: `<<<<<<< username-config`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>> gh-pages`.
  1. With the merge conflict markers removed, click **Mark as resolved**. Congratulations, you successfully resolved a merge conflict! Go ahead and merge the pull request.
