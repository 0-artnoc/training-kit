  To explain a merge conflict, it might be useful to have an example. Imagine we are creating a template for people to describe themselves. You might have something like looks like this:

  ```
  Name: First Last
  Location: I Live Here
  Favorite Animal: Octocat
  ```

  Now lets imagine that two collaborators on the project decide to change the default `Favorite Animal` in the template. So you might have something that looks like this:

  **Collaborator 1**
  ```
  Favorite Animal: Panda
  ```

  **Collaborator 2**
  ```
  Favorite Animal: Capybura
  ```
