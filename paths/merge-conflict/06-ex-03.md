  So, our resume is slowly taking shape, after modifying the contact information in the `_config.yml` file, we turned our attention to the `experience.yml` file, to wrap up, we need to finish adding our _education_ and _interests_ information.

  1. In your imported version of the repository, checkout to the branch named: `username-education`.
  1. While on that branch, open the `_data/education.yml` file.
  1. Modify on the content in the `degree`, `uni`, `year`, and `summary` lines.

      > The `education.yml` file supports displaying awards you may have received, you can add that on a new line between `year:` and `summary:`.

  1. Save your changes to the `education.yml` file and create a new commit.
  1. While on the `username-edu` branch, open the `_data/interests.yml` file.
  1. Replace the existing interests with your interests. For example `description: Learning about Git and GitHub` could be one of your interests.
  1. Save your changes to the `interests.yml` file and create a new commit.
  1. With your changes committed on your local copy of the repository, `push` your changes to your remote repository.
  1. Create a new pull request. Use the **base:** of `master` and the **compare:** of `username-education`.
  1. Although GitHub reports that you **Can't automatically merge** these changes, you can still click **Create pull request**.
  1. In the **This branch has conflicts that must be resolved** section of the pull request, you can click the **Resolve conflicts** button to resolve the merge conflict.
  1. It would appear that Gene and Louise Belcher recently made changes to the `master` branch and modified the same files you did, this is what is causing the merge conflicts.

  1. Similar to when we had to resolve a merge conflict with Bob's changes, remove Gene's contributions from the `education.yml` and Louise's contributions from the `interests.yml` files. If you need a refresher on how to resolve a merge conflict, check the **I need a refresher** section below.
  1. With the merge conflict markers removed, click **Mark as resolved**.
