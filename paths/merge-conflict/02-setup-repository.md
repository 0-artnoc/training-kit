  To participate in this course, you are going to need to **import** a project from the [GitHub School organization](https://github.com/githubschool). Importing a project will essentially copy the repository including all of the files, branches and history to your account.

  [![instructions for using the repository import tool](../../images/gifs/merge-conflict/import-repo.gif)](../../images/gifs/merge-conflict/import-repo.gif)

  1. While logged into GitHub, navigate to the [Import tool](https://github.com/new/import).
  1. In the **Your old repository's clone URL** field, enter this: `https://github.com/githubschool/on-demand-merge-conflict.git`.
  1. Ensure that the **Owner** field is your account.
  1. In the **Name** field, enter a new name for your repository. Since this course not only teaches you about merge conflicts but also provides a GitHub Pages powered resume template, maybe something like `resume` would work.
  1. Select **Public** under the privacy options.
  1. Click **Begin import**.
