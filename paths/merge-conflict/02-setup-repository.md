  To participate in this course, you are going to need to **import** an a project the GitHub Training team created for this course. Importing a project will essentially copy the repository including all of the files and revision history to your account.

  1. While logged into GitHub, navigate to the [Import tool](https://github.com/new/import).
  1. In the **Your old repository's clone URL** field, enter this: `https://github.com/githubtraining/on-demand-merge-conflict.git`.
  1. Ensure that the **Owner** field is your account.
  1. In the **Name** field, enter a new name for your repository. Since this course not only teaches you about merge conflicts but also provides a GitHub Pages powered resume template, maybe something like `resume` would work.
  1. Select the **Public** privacy option.
  1. Click the **Begin import** button.
