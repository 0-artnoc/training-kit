  Unlike our other [courses](https://services.github.com/on-demand/), this course doesn't follow a linear path and you can jump into any of the different scenarios provided. So `git` ready to learn about how to get out of trouble with a healthy dose of terrible `git` puns.

  ## [Too Many (small) Commits!](/on-demand/git-trouble/03)

  While you were making changes you might have created a bunch of tiny commits, but when it comes time to actually push your changes back to your `remote`, you want to prevent your commit history from being inundated with the 30 commits you just made. This scenario guides you through creating a more concise history.   

  ## [Commit Message Sucks](/on-demand/git-trouble/04)

  'Edited stuff' might have seemed like a decent commit message at 3am, but in hindsight, you might want to provide a _little_ more context. Covering the different commands you can use to `revert` the error of your commit message-ways, this scenario identifies how to get more descriptive.

  ## [Commit to Wrong Branch](/on-demand/git-trouble/05)

  So you got excited about making some changes and accidentally committed your changes to the wrong branch? Happens **all** the time. This scenario walks you through the steps required to successfully remove those commits and commit them to the right branch, even if you already pushed them up!

  ## [Accidental Commit](/on-demand/git-trouble/06)

  Did you make a commit before you had actually finished all of the related changes? Maybe you left one lonely little change in the working directory? Perhaps your commit included changes that were unrelated. In either case, we can fix that, just follow along and `git` out of trouble.

  ## [Just Make it Go Away!](/on-demand/git-trouble/07)

  Sometimes that exciting new feature takes a turn for the worse and you just want to make it all go away. Have no fear, we can make that happen.
