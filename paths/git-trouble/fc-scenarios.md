  Unlike our other [courses](https://services.github.com/on-demand/), this course doesn't follow a linear learning path and you can jump into any of the different scenarios provided. So `git` ready to learn about how to get out of trouble with a healthy dose of terrible `git` puns.

  ## [Too Many (small) Commits!](/on-demand/git-trouble/03)

  While you were making changes you might have created a bunch of tiny commits to keep track of the changes you were making, but when it comes time to actually push your changes back to your `remote`, you want to group your commits together and prevent your commit history from being inundated with the 30 commits you just made. This scenario guides you through `squashing` those commits and creating more condensed commits.   

  ## [Commit Message Sucks](/on-demand/git-trouble/04)

  'Edited stuff' might have seemed like a decent commit message at 3am, but in hindsight, you might realize you want to provide a _little_ more context. Covering the different commands you can use to `revert` the error of your commit message-ways, this scenario identifies how to get more descriptive.

  ## [Commit to Wrong Branch](/on-demand/git-trouble/05)

  So you got excited about making some changes and accidentally committed your changes to the wrong branch? Happens **all** the time. This scenario walks you through the steps required to successfully remove those commits and commit them to the right branch, even if you already pushed them up!

  ## [Accidental Commit](/on-demand/git-trouble/06)

  During your workflow, you might have gotten excited and made a commit before you had actually finished. Maybe you made the commit without adding all of the related files. Perhaps your commit included changes that were unrelated. In either case, we can fix that, just follow along and `git` out of trouble.

  ## [Commit Broke EVERYTHING](/on-demand/git-trouble/07)

  The sky is **not** falling down chicken little, we can make everything right-as-rain, and this scenario shows you how to fix that last commit.
